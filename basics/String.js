//we are learning string
//so firstly the value which we put in between this " " double quotes and in ' ' both single and double works.
let name="vivek"
let age=20
let city="delhi"

//for printing all values lets concat these strings 
console.log(name+" "+age+" "+city)

//we can print with this format also
console.log(`my name is ${name} and my age is ${age} from ${city}`)
